-- 0 reviews - NO
-- 1-5 reviews - FEW
-- 6-15 reviews - SOME
-- 16-40 reviews - MANY
-- >= 40 reviews - A LOT

-- do classification (case when)
-- group by reviews_qualification
-- aggregate min, avg, and max price

-- Estimate the growth of Airbnb each year using the number of hosts registered as the growth metric. The rate of growth is calculated by taking the ((number of hosts registered in the current year - number of hosts registered in the prev year)/ the number of hosts registered in the prev year) * 100.

-- Output the year, the number of hosts in the current year, number of hosts in the previous year and the rate of growth. Round the rate of growth to the nearest percent and order the result in the ascending order based on the year.

-- Assume that the dataset consists only of unique hosts, meaning there are no duplicate hosts listed.
