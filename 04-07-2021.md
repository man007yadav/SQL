-- Find the second highest marks

students : id | marks

-- 1. order by marks desc and make it distinct
-- 2. pick the second highest marks

```sql
SELECT (DISTINCT marks)
FROM students
    ORDER BY marks DESC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```

```sql

SELECT MAX(marks)
    FROM students
    WHERE marks <  SELECT MAX(marks)
                        FROM students;
```

-- Find the shortest distance between pair of points

points : x | y

-- python
-- for pi in points:
        for pj in points:
            if pi != pj:
                d(x, y)

-- Twin for loop is signal to use joins

```sql
SELECT MIN(SQRT(POW(P1.x - P2.x, 2), POW(P1.y - P2.y, 2))) AS min_dist
    FROM points P1 JOIN points P2
        ON P1.x != P2.x OR P1.y != P2.y;
```

-- Select customers who purchased atleast 2 items and on 2 different dates

orders : cust | item | date

-- 1. group by cust, get distinct item_counts and date_counts
-- 2. filter item_counts >=2 and date_counts >=2

```sql
SELECT cust, COUNT(DISTINCT(item)) AS item_counts,
        COUNT(DISTINCT(date)) AS date_counts
FROM orders
    GROUP BY cust
    HAVING item_counts >= 2 AND date_counts >= 2
```

-- Find players who scored more than all spanish players and more than atleast 1 german player.

score : player | country | goals

-- 1. goals > ALL(spanish players)
-- 2. goals > ANY(german players)

```sql
SELECT player, country, goals 
    FROM score s
    WHERE s.goals > ALL(SELECT s1.goals FROM score s1 WHERE s1.country = 'Spain')
        AND s.goals > ANY(SELECT s2.goals FROM score s2 WHERE s2.county = 'Germany');
```

-- Instead of using ALL and ANY in above query we can use SELECT MAX(s1.goals) and SELECT MIN(s2.goals)


-- Print districts whose total_capacity >= avg capacity of all districts

water_schemes : scheme_no | district_name | capacity

-- 1. Temporary table group by district sum capacity
-- 2. Temporary table get avg capacity for each district from above table
-- 3. Cross product of above 2 tables where total.capacity >= total_avg.capacity

```sql
WITH total(name, capacity) AS
    SELECT district_name, SUM(capacity)
        FROM water_schemes
            GROUP BY district_name;

WITH total_avg(capacity) AS
    SELECT AVG(capacity)
        FROM total;

SELECT total.name
FROM total, total_avg
    WHERE total.capacity >= total_avg.capacity;
```
